# Lingleaf — product spec

Shared by [lingleaf-ios](https://github.com/erobinsonc/lingleaf-ios) and
[lingleaf-android](https://github.com/erobinsonc/lingleaf-android). Both
apps implement every scenario below; each scenario is covered by tests with
the same intent on both platforms. A change to behaviour updates this file in
**both** repositories.

## Principles

- Learn English by reading real books. The reader is the product.
- No accounts, ads or tracking. Data stays on the device.
- Network only for: the Gutenberg catalog and downloads (`gutendex.com`,
  `gutenberg.org`) and word definitions (`api.dictionaryapi.dev`). HTTPS only.
- Translation runs on the device (Apple Translation on iOS, Google ML Kit on Android).
- Interface in English and Spanish; more languages welcome.

## Scenarios

| ID | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | First launch | Library shows 3 bundled stories (A1, A2, B1) and the daily goal card. |
| S2 | Open a book | Reader shows the text; returning later reopens at the same paragraph. |
| S3 | Tap a word | A card shows the base form ("animals" → "animal"), IPA, translation, definition, the sentence and its translation. Translation starts when the card opens, alongside the definition. The translation is in the learner's language; a small language button under it changes the language in place. |
| S4 | Save word | "Save word" (primary, right) saves the word for review; it is underlined in yellow in every book, including inflected forms. A message "“word” saved to Words" with Undo shows for 4 s, longer when the system asks for more time to act (Android's accessibility timeout); with a screen reader or switch control it stays until Undo, Close or a newer message. |
| S5 | I know it | "I know it" (secondary, left) saves the word as known; it is not underlined or reviewed. A message "“word” marked as known" with Undo shows like S4. |
| S6 | Listen | Word, sentence and paragraph can be read aloud with an English voice. |
| S7 | Review | Recall first: a due word shows alone with "Show meaning"; the meaning then shows the translation, the sentence it was saved from (the word in bold), that sentence's translation (in the current translation language, filled in on the device when missing) and a button to hear it, and only then "Again" and "I remembered". A new word is first due at the start of the next review day (days start at 04:00 local time); "I remembered" moves it to the next box, due at the start of the day 1, 3, 7, 14 then 30 days later, and after the last box it is learned; "Again" sends it back to the first box and repeats it in the session. A session holds at most 20 due words, interleaved by book. At the end: "Done for today." and, when there are any, "N more tomorrow."; if more words are still due now, "Done for now. N more due today." with "Keep going". |
| S8 | Daily goal | Reading time counts while the reader is open; the card shows minutes today and the streak (days meeting the goal). |
| S9 | Discover | Recommended classics with a level, search by title/author, one-tap download into the library. |
| S10 | Import | A plain-text `.txt` file can be imported; Gutenberg license headers are removed. |
| S11 | Settings | Daily goal, text size, speech speed and translation language persist. "Translate into" shows "Ask me when I tap a word" until a language is chosen. |
| S12 | Offline | Without internet the reader, saved words and review work; the card says translation/definition are unavailable (a platform may name the reason, e.g. Android needs Wi‑Fi once to download the language). Saving a word never waits for translation; a missing translation is filled in on the device as soon as it is available, and Review shows "No translation yet. Connect to the internet once to get it." until then. |
| S13 | Level filter | Discover shows chips "All" plus each level in the recommended list (A2–C2); "All" is selected by default, a level shows only its recommended books, in order; an empty level says "No recommended books at this level."; the chips hide while search results show. |
| S14 | Translation language | The default is the first language in the device's preferred-language list that is supported and not English (Chinese → Simplified). If there is none, the first word card asks once "Translate into:" with up to 5 languages (the region's language first, then Español, Português, Français, 中文, العربية, without repeats) and "More languages"; the choice is saved. Each saved word records its translation language; words in another language are translated again when shown. |
| S15 | Saved state on the card | A saved word's card shows "Saved" or "I know it" checked (check icon, selected state, announced as "Remove from Words" action); tapping the checked button removes that state, with Undo (timing as in S4). Deleting a word in Words happens at once and offers Undo for 5 s with the same rules (no confirmation dialog). The language button under the translation is announced as "Translation language: <language>". |

## Shared logic (same rules, same tests on both platforms)

- Paragraphs: split on blank lines, hard-wrapped lines joined.
- Words: `[A-Za-z]+(['’][A-Za-z]+)*`; contractions stay whole.
- Base forms: irregular table, then plural/past/-ing rules (see `TextTools`).
- Spaced repetition: boxes with 1, 3, 7, 14, 30 day intervals, each due at the start of that review day (04:00 local time; 01:00 still belongs to the day before); a new word is due at the start of the next review day; "Again" → first box, due now.
- Marking a saved word in a sentence: its forms (match keys), or a saved group of words, ignoring case.
- Review session: due words sorted by due time, grouped by book, taken one per book in turn, at most 20.
- Streak: consecutive days meeting the goal; an unfinished today doesn't break it.
- Translation language pick: preferred-language list order; skip English and unsupported; `zh-*` → Simplified Chinese; none → ask.
- Words needing translation: empty translation, or a translation language that is not recorded (words saved before it was) or differs from the current one.
- Recommended books (Gutenberg id, level), easiest first: A2 21; B1 55, 16, 236; B2 11, 74, 120, 1661;
  C1 1342, 84, 174, 1400, 345; C2 2701, 219, 145. Levels: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2. The level filter keeps order.
- Imported .txt: title is the file name without its extension (empty → "Book"); Gutenberg header/footer removed; files over 10 MB or with no text are refused.
