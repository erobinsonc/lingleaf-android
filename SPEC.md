# Lingleaf — product spec

Shared by [lingleaf-ios](https://github.com/erobinsonc/lingleaf-ios) and
[lingleaf-android](https://github.com/erobinsonc/lingleaf-android). Both
apps implement every scenario below; each scenario is covered by tests with
the same intent on both platforms. A change to behaviour updates this file in
**both** repositories.

## Principles

- Learn English by reading real books. The reader is the product.
- No accounts, ads or tracking. Data stays on the device.
- Network only for: Gutenberg search (`gutendex.com`), book downloads and covers
  (`www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/`) and word definitions (`api.dictionaryapi.dev`). HTTPS only.
- Translation runs on the device (Apple Translation on iOS, Google ML Kit on Android).
- Interface in English and Spanish; more languages welcome.

## Scenarios

| ID | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | First launch | Library shows 3 bundled stories (A1, A2, B1) and the daily goal card. |
| S2 | Open a book | Reader shows the text; returning later reopens at the same paragraph. |
| S3 | Tap a word | A card shows the base form ("animals" → "animal"), IPA, translation, definition, the sentence and its translation. Translation starts when the card opens, alongside the definition. The translation is in the learner's language; a small language button under it changes the language in place. |
| S4 | Save word | "Save word" (primary, right) saves the word for review; it is underlined in yellow in every book, including inflected forms. A message "“word” saved to Words" with Undo shows for 4 s, longer when the system asks for more time to act (Android's accessibility timeout); with a screen reader or switch control it stays until Undo, Close or a newer message. |
| S5 | I know it | "I know it" (secondary, left) saves the word as known; it is not underlined or reviewed. A message "“word” marked as known" with Undo shows like S4. |
| S6 | Listen | Word, sentence and paragraph can be read aloud with an English voice. |
| S7 | Review | Due words appear as flashcards; "I know it" schedules them 1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days out, then marks them learned; "Again" repeats them. |
| S8 | Daily goal | Reading time counts while the reader is open; the card shows minutes today and the streak (days meeting the goal). |
| S9 | Discover | The recommended classics ship with the app (title, author, level) and show at once; covers load from Project Gutenberg. Search by title/author shows "Searching Project Gutenberg…", after 8 s also "Still searching. Project Gutenberg can be slow." with Cancel; a new search cancels the previous one; a failed search says "You're offline. Connect to the internet to search." or "Project Gutenberg didn't answer. Try again." with Retry, and the recommended books stay below. "Get" downloads the plain text straight from Project Gutenberg's file cache with a progress ring (tapping it cancels) and turns into "Read", which opens the book; a failed download says why in its row ("This book isn't available right now." for 403/404/410 or an empty book; offline; "Project Gutenberg didn't answer. Try again.") with Retry when it may pass. |
| S10 | Import | A plain-text `.txt` file can be imported; Gutenberg license headers are removed. |
| S11 | Settings | Daily goal, text size, speech speed and translation language persist. "Translate into" shows "Ask me when I tap a word" until a language is chosen. |
| S12 | Offline | Without internet the reader, saved words and review work; the card says translation/definition are unavailable (a platform may name the reason, e.g. Android needs Wi‑Fi once to download the language). Saving a word never waits for translation; a missing translation is filled in on the device as soon as it is available, and Review shows "No translation yet. Connect to the internet once to get it." until then. |
| S13 | Level filter | Discover shows chips "All" plus each level in the recommended list (A2–C2); "All" is selected by default, a level shows only its recommended books, in order; an empty level says "No recommended books at this level."; the chips hide while search results show. |
| S14 | Translation language | The default is the first language in the device's preferred-language list that is supported and not English (Chinese → Simplified). If there is none, the first word card asks once "Translate into:" with up to 5 languages (the region's language first, then Español, Português, Français, 中文, العربية, without repeats) and "More languages"; the choice is saved. Each saved word records its translation language; words in another language are translated again when shown. |
| S15 | Saved state on the card | A saved word's card shows "Saved" or "I know it" checked (check icon, selected state, announced as "Remove from Words" action); tapping the checked button removes that state, with Undo (timing as in S4). Deleting a word in Words happens at once and offers Undo for 5 s with the same rules (no confirmation dialog). The language button under the translation is announced as "Translation language: <language>". |

## Shared logic (same rules, same tests on both platforms)

- Paragraphs: split on blank lines, hard-wrapped lines joined.
- Words: `[A-Za-z]+(['’][A-Za-z]+)*`; contractions stay whole.
- Base forms: irregular table, then plural/past/-ing rules (see `TextTools`).
- Spaced repetition: boxes with 1, 3, 7, 14, 30 day intervals.
- Streak: consecutive days meeting the goal; an unfinished today doesn't break it.
- Translation language pick: preferred-language list order; skip English and unsupported; `zh-*` → Simplified Chinese; none → ask.
- Words needing translation: empty translation, or a translation language that is not recorded (words saved before it was) or differs from the current one.
- Book downloads: `https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/{id}/pg{id}.txt`; covers `…/pg{id}.cover.medium.jpg`. A weekly CI job checks every recommended link.
- Recommended books (Gutenberg id, level), easiest first: A2 21; B1 55, 16, 236; B2 11, 74, 120, 1661;
  C1 1342, 84, 174, 1400, 345; C2 2701, 219, 145. Levels: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2. The level filter keeps order.
- Imported .txt: title is the file name without its extension (empty → "Book"); Gutenberg header/footer removed; files over 10 MB or with no text are refused.
